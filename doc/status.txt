Status of CamelForth projects by wa1tnr - June 2019

A quick survey suggests that the QSPI flashROM
work was done last for NeoTrellis M4 (SAMD51)
and was based in YAFFA (only).

This makes it appear there is no Arduino IDE based
port of CamelForth as of June 1, 2019 (by wa1tnr).

Other programmers may've done so (unknown!)

TODO: Port CamelForth to Arduino IDE in the most
rudamentary way (with as little changes to the
upstream code as is practical).

From there, consider adding QSPI flashROM support
(from existing published sources on github by
other programmers).
