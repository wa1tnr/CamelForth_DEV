Status of CamelForth projects by wa1tnr - June 2019

A quick survey suggests that the QSPI flashROM
work was done last for NeoTrellis M4 (SAMD51)
and was based in YAFFA (only).

This makes it appear there is no Arduino IDE based
port of CamelForth as of June 1, 2019 (by wa1tnr).

Other programmers may've done so (unknown!)

TODO: Port CamelForth to Arduino IDE in the most
rudamentary way (with as little changes to the
upstream code as is practical).

From there, consider adding QSPI flashROM support
(from existing published sources on github by
other programmers).

As far as can be determined (quickly!) all CamelForth
ports by wa1tnr, to date, are based in AtmelStart.
That's as of 1 June 2019.

The AtmelStart based programming began with the USART
and (most likely) SAMD21.  The basic goal there was to
create a primitive text interpreter from within the
AtmelStart context.  This work was done near June 2018
(last year).

A hardware driver was written from scratch, with help
from an oscilloscope (as well as the Silabs USB to UART
bridge chip - in this instance, a PiUART (spelling?)).
The driver produced did not read remote keyboard input
(from a human at a serial terminal) but rather, dumped
data from the SAMD target, via the TX/RX pair, through
the UART to USB bridge, and then to the human at the
terminal (connected via USB).

CP2104 is that bridge chip.
